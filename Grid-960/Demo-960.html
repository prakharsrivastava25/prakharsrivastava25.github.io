		<h1>Essay on Cow</h1>
			This is the essay on "Cow" which was (supposedly) written by some student 
			in the course of completing the "Indian Civil Services Examination" :-)

			I bet you will enjoy this.

			Sachi

			PS : There are no typos in this essay. Everything is legal and as it was
			     written in the exam.If you develop cramps reading this or find your
			     English gone haywire after reading this, please dont blame me :-)
			     
			     CALCUTTA's Telegraph has got hold of an answer paper of a candidate at the
			recent UPSC examinations. The candidate has written an essay on the Indian
			cow:

			"The cow is a successful animal. Also he is quadrupud, and because he is 
			female, he give milk,but will do so when he is got child.He is same like
			God,sacred to Hindus and useful to man.But he has got four legs together.
			Two are forward and two are afterwards.

			"His whole body can be utilised for use. More so the milk. What can it do?
			Various ghee, butter,cream, curd, why and the condensed milk and so forth.
			Also he is useful to cobbler, watermans and mankind generally.

			"His motion is slow only because he is of asitudinious species.  Also his
			other motion is much useful to trees, plants as well as making flat cakes in
			hand and drying in the sun. Cow is the only animal that extricates his feeding
			after eating.  Then afterwards she chew with his teeth whom are situated in
			the inside of the mouth.  He is incessantly in the meadows in the grass.

			"His only attacking and defending organ is the horn, specially so when he is 
			got child.  This is done by knowing his head whereby he causes the weapons
			to be paralleled to the ground of the earth and instantly proceed with great 
			velocity forwards.

			"He has got tails also, but not like similar animals.  It has hairs on the
			other end of the other side.  This is done to frighten away the flies which
			alight on his cohoa body whereupon he gives hit with it.

			The palms of his feet are soft unto the touch.  So the grasses head is not
			crushed.  At night time have poses by looking down on the ground and he shouts
			his eyes like his relatives, the horse does not do so.

			"This is the cow."

			P.S.: We are informed that the candidate passed the exam.

				<h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
					Whose woods these are I think I know.
					His house is in the village though;
					He will not see me stopping here
					To watch his woods fill up with snow.

					My little horse must think it queer
					To stop without a farmhouse near
					Between the woods and frozen lake
					The darkest evening of the year.

					He gives his harness bells a shake
					To ask if there is some mistake
					The only other sound’s the sweep
					Of easy wind and downy flake.

					The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
					But I have promises to keep,
					And miles to go before I sleep,
					And miles to go before I sleep.
					

					Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, 1923
					by Robert Frost (26 March 1874 – 29 January 1963)

				<h1>Rain Drop</h1>
				This leaf, so complete in itself,
				Is only part of the tree.
				And this tree, so complete in itself,
				Is only part of the forest.
				And the forest runs down from the hill to the sea,
				And the sea, so complete in itself,
				Rests like a raindrop
				In the hand of God.
				
				Rain Drop by Ruskin Bond

				<h1>Twinkle twinkle little star</h1>
					Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
					How I wonder what you are! 
					Up above the world so high, 
					Like a diamond in the sky. 

					When the blazing sun is gone, 
					When he nothing shines upon, 
					Then you show your little light, 
					Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. 

					Then the traveler in the dark 
					Thanks you for your tiny spark, 
					How could he see where to go, 
					If you did not twinkle so? 

					In the dark blue sky you keep, 
					Often through my curtains peep 
					For you never shut your eye, 
					Till the sun is in the sky. 

					As your bright and tiny spark 
					Lights the traveler in the dark, 
					Though I know not what you are, 
					Twinkle, twinkle, little star
					
					Twinkle Twinkle little star by Jane Taylor
